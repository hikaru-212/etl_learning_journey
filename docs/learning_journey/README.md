# Learning Journey

This folder documents the **personal learning journey** behind the ETL project.  
While the main [README](../../README.md) focuses on the *features* and *roadmap*,  
this section captures the **mindset, lessons learned, and thought process** at each stage.  

The goal is to show not just *what* was built, but *why each step was necessary*.  
It is written as a mix of technical notes, reflections, and even mistakes — because  
learning is not linear, and every failure shaped the eventual design.

## 📂 Folder Structure

- **[en/](./en/)** → English notes and reflections  
- **[zh/](./zh/)** → 中文紀錄與反思  

Each folder contains the same stages (0–5), but written in different languages.  
Choose the one that’s more comfortable for you.

## Stages Covered (English)

- [Stage 0: The Crucial Mindset Shift](./en/stage0_mindset.md)  
  *Why start small? Lessons from over-ambition and the importance of MVP thinking.*  

- [Stage 1: Core MVP (File-based)] *(to be added)*  
  *Building the simplest possible ETL flow with files, focusing on logic not infrastructure.*  

- [Stage 2: Database Integration & Modularity] *(to be added)*  
  *Transitioning from files to Postgres, introducing modular code structure.*  

- [Stage 3: Validation & Reliability] *(to be added)*
  *Why validation, idempotency, and logging are not "extras" but foundations of trust.*  

- [Stage 4: Orchestration & Permissions] *(to be added)*  
  *From scripts to workflows — Docker, scheduling, and secure role-based access.*  

- [Stage 5: Scaling & ETL vs ELT] *(to be added)*  
  *Designing a fair comparison, first locally, then re-running on cloud MPP systems.*

## Why This Exists

Most repos only show final code.  
This folder is different: it preserves the **learning curve**, including wrong turns, AI-assisted reflections, and key insights.  

If the main repo is about *building pipelines*,  
this folder is about *building the engineer*.
