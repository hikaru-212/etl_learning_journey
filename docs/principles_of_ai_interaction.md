# Principles of AI Interaction

*(My personal principles for interacting with AI as a learning partner)*

## Core Spirit: A Closed-Loop Truth-Seeking System

My interaction with AI is not a simple Q&A.  
It is a **closed-loop process** that allows me to absorb and integrate knowledge efficiently.

## 1. Motivation: Curiosity Triggered by Ambiguity

- When I encounter something unclear, I feel a strong drive to resolve it.  
- I don’t reject ambiguity in real-world situations — I can operate under uncertainty.  
- But I strive to **reduce conceptual ambiguity** by asking precise questions until I reach clarity.  
- This pursuit of clarity is the fuel for my learning speed.  

*(Framing: I can operate in uncertainty, but I refuse to think unclearly.)*

## 2. Method: A Chain Reaction of Reasoning

My dialogue with AI follows the logic of the **scientific method**:

1. **Hypothesize**: *“I think this concept should work like this, right?”*  
2. **Verify**: *“Is my understanding correct?”*  
3. **Instantiate**: *“Can you give me a simple example?”*  
4. **Challenge the Premise**: *“If even the example doesn’t make sense, maybe the question itself is wrong?”*

This loop continues until a coherent conclusion is reached.

## 3. Outcome: Internalized Knowledge, Not Borrowed Information

- What I gain is not just “answers from outside,”  
  but **insights that I have tested, refined, and integrated** with my prior knowledge.  
- To outsiders, this looks like “rapid learning.”  
- To me, it is simply **asking all the questions until the puzzle pieces fit together.**

## 4. Mindset: AI as a Socratic Partner

- I don’t treat AI as a final authority.  
- I treat it as a **conversational encyclopedia** or an **untiring Socratic partner**.  
- **AI provides the material (What)**, but **I build the structure (Why & How)**.  
- The steering wheel is always in my hands; AI is the accelerator, not the driver.

## ✅ One-Sentence Summary

My learning speed does not come from “depending on AI.”  
It comes from having a **closed-loop reasoning process**,  
where AI acts as a catalyst that helps me turn doubts into structured insights.
