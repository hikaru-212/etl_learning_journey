# Foundational Training Plan

## Purpose
Before moving into Stage 1 implementation, I decided to dedicate two weeks to deliberate practice.  
The goal is to internalize core algorithmic and programming patterns from first principles,  
so that when I start coding the pipeline, my execution will be both faster and more robust.

This plan acts as a **bridge**:  
- Stage 0 (Mindset & Blueprint) ‚Üí Stage 1 (First implementation)

---

## Structure of the Plan

The training is organized into **7 modules**, each focusing on a critical competency:  

1. **Data Structures Basics**  
   Arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues.  
   Focus: reasoning about time/space trade-offs.

2. **Algorithms Fundamentals**  
   Sorting, searching, recursion, complexity analysis.  
   Focus: building intuition for efficiency.

3. **Python & SQL Essential Patterns**  
   Idiomatic Python for loops, list/dict/set usage.  
   SQL query building with `JOIN`, `GROUP BY`, `CTE`.

4. **Error Handling & Validation**  
   How to debug, use exceptions, write safe data checks.  
   Pandera for ETL, ENUM/constraints for DB.

5. **Versioning & Modularity**  
   Writing small functions, reusable modules, separation of concerns.

6. **Automation Mindset**  
   Practicing tasks like copying formulas, daily data cleanups.  
   Translating ‚Äúmanual Excel logic‚Äù ‚Üí Python automation.

7. **System Thinking & Integration**  
   Connecting Python ‚Üî SQL, building small pipelines.  
   Focusing on *why* each tool is needed, and what happens without it.

## Daily Routine
- ~3 hours of coding exercises (Python/SQL).
- ~1 hour of reviewing notes and consolidating patterns.
- ~30 min reflection log: What was confusing? How did I resolve it?

---

## Expected Outcome
- Solid grasp of algorithmic fundamentals.  
- Fluency in Python + SQL for ETL tasks.  
- Ability to explain tools by answering:
  - **What does this tool do?**
  - **Why do I need it?**
  - **What happens if I don‚Äôt use it?**

## Relation to the Project
This plan ensures that when Stage 1 begins, I won‚Äôt just be *copying code*.  
I will be implementing with confidence, backed by a clear architectural blueprint and internalized fundamentals.

üëâ This is the ‚ÄúBlueprint First, Code Second‚Äù philosophy in practice.
