# 🧭 A Self-Learner’s Methodology: From Overview to Execution  

Reflections from completing my first end-to-end local project, and how these experiences shape my approach to future learning.  

## 1. Bird’s-Eye View Before Landing  
- **The 30,000-Foot View (Holistic Mode):** I start by asking AI or other resources to provide me with a **full enterprise-grade system blueprint**, so I can quickly understand all possible modules, features, and dependencies.  
  👉 This helps me avoid working without clarity — instead, I gain a clear map that shows which parts are **core** and which are **enablers**.  
  *Note:* The goal here is to **understand design principles** and **the relationships between modules**, not simply to copy them.  

- **Ground-Level Execution (MVP Mode):** With the big picture in mind, I strip away all complexity to build a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) that achieves one goal: a single, working end-to-end run.
  👉 This allows me to deliver a working demo quickly, while avoiding being overwhelmed by tools or enabler features too early.  
  *Note:* The MVP is only the **first step**. Its purpose is to **validate and establish the foundation quickly**, then gradually integrate Enablers based on real needs.

## 2. Validate Necessity, Then Incrementally Add  
- As I move between the holistic view and the MVP, I keep asking myself:  
  **“Is this component or feature really necessary?”**  
- I only add functionality if it **solves a real problem** (core) or acts as a true **enabler** that the industry commonly requires.  
- This discipline prevents "gold-plating"—adding features that are nice but non-essential.
- It also minimizes technical debt by ensuring every component serves a clear purpose, simplifying future maintenance and debugging.

## 3. Knowledge Consolidation and Reflection  
- For every feature I implement, I document:  
  1. **Why am I doing this?**  
  2. **What happens if I don’t?**  
  3. **Where does it fit in the overall picture (core vs. enabler)?**  
  4. **Is there a better way?**  
  5. **If I handed this project to another person, how would I organize my code and documentation so they could onboard quickly?**  
- This ensures I’m not just “writing code,” but systematically building a **personal methodology and knowledge system**.

## 4. The Core Essence of My Approach  
- **Combining “Learner’s Exploration” with “Engineer’s Pragmatism”:**  
  - As a learner → I need the holistic view to avoid blind spots.  
  - As an engineer → I need the MVP to deliver quickly.  
- My method fuses the two: **Bird’s-eye view first, MVP grounding second; validate necessity before layering on enablers; conclude with reflection and consolidation.**

## 📊 Core vs Enabler  

| Category | Core | Enabler |
|----------|------|---------|
| **Definition** | Essential functions required for the system to operate | Features that enhance, extend, or strengthen the system |
| **Purpose** | Ensure that the basic workflow can run successfully | Bring the system closer to enterprise-grade standards |
| **Examples** | Data ingestion, transformation, database load, basic validation | Workflow orchestration (e.g., Airflow DAGs), monitoring and alerts (e.g., Slack), CI/CD pipelines, permission and access control |
| **Risk if Missing** | The system cannot function at all | The system still runs, but with reduced stability, reliability, or scalability |
| **Learning Value** | Teaches fundamental mechanics of ETL/engineering | Teaches professional practices and production-readiness |


### 💡 Important Note:  
The distinction between Core and Enabler is not absolute. As projects scale, teams grow, or system stability demands increase, what was once considered an “Enabler” — such as workflow orchestration or access control — may become **Core** in a new stage because of its critical impact on reliability and maintainability.  


👉 This methodology allows me to quickly deliver MVPs while progressively moving toward enterprise-grade architecture.  
It demonstrates not only technical execution but also **strategic and reflective learning ability**.
