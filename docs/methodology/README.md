# 🧩 Learning Methodology Overview

This folder documents my **self-engineering methodology** —  
how I structure my learning, training, and reflection as if building a scalable system.

It contains three layers, each serving a specific role in my growth architecture:

---

## 1️⃣ Foundational Training Plan  
📄 [00_foundational_training_plan.md](./en/00_foundational_training_plan.md)
[中文版](./zh/00_foundational_training_plan.md)

Focus: **First principles & deliberate practice.**  
I designed this plan as the bridge from Stage 0 (Mindset) to Stage 1 (Implementation).  
It emphasizes algorithmic reasoning, Python/SQL fundamentals, and system thinking —  
building a strong base before any coding begins.

## 2️⃣ Practical Modules Training  
📄 [01_practical_modules_training.md](./en/01_practical_modules_training.md)  
[中文版](./zh/01_practical_modules_training.md) 

Focus: **Hands-on fluency.**  
A structured 7-module plan blending Python patterns, SQL logic, and LeetCode-style problems.  
Each module reinforces core programming reflexes and pattern recognition  
to prepare for actual ETL and automation coding tasks.

## 3️⃣ Learning Methodology Reflection  
📄 [learning_methodology_en.md](./en/learning_methodology_en.md)  
[中文版](./zh/learning_methodology_zh.md)

Focus: **Meta-learning and strategy.**  
This document summarizes how I combine “Learner’s Exploration” and “Engineer’s Pragmatism”:  
- Start from the 30,000-foot view (holistic understanding)  
- Build a minimal viable implementation (MVP)  
- Validate necessity before layering Enablers  
- Reflect and consolidate into a personal knowledge system  

Together, these three components form my **Learning Engine** —  
a feedback loop that continuously turns experience into structure,  
and structure into capability.

## 🔄 Future Direction
- Translate all materials into Chinese for bilingual accessibility  
- Integrate this methodology with future Compass-based validation pipelines  
- Create visual flowcharts connecting training → execution → reflection
