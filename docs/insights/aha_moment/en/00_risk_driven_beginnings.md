## The Spark: A Simple GitHub Question
*(2025-08-10)*

When I was about to push my first code to GitHub, one question stopped me:  
*"If my database password is inside the script, won’t everyone see it once it’s public?"*

That single worry triggered a chain of realizations:

- If exposed, anyone could connect to my database.  
- If connected, they could **delete everything**.  
- If all users had the same rights, one bad action could destroy the system.  

This was my first independent encounter with **risk-driven design**.

## The Aha! Moment: Privilege Separation

Without knowing the formal term, I reasoned that:

- Users should have **different levels of permission**.  
- Most accounts should only **read**, not write or delete.  
- Only trusted accounts should control critical actions.  

What I had rediscovered was the **Principle of Least Privilege** —  
not from a book, but from a thought experiment grounded in a real risk.

## A Real-World Echo

Later, I saw news of a developer who accidentally leaked hardcoded credentials on a livestream,  
leading to catastrophic financial losses.  

That incident confirmed what I had already deduced:  
so-called *best practices* are often **written in the scars of past failures**.

## The Seed of a Philosophy

This experience planted the seed for my later frameworks:

- **Always start from risks.**  
- **Distinguish what directly creates value (Core) from what protects it (Enablers).**  
- **Design as if failure is inevitable — because it often is.**  

What began with a GitHub password became the root of a mindset that grew into  
my later insights: **Core vs. Enablers**, **Input–Bridge–Output**, and beyond.

## ✅ One-Sentence Summary

Before Airflow, before Pandera, before ETL pipelines —  
my very first “aha” was realizing that **separating privileges is not optional**.  
It was the seed that grew into my way of thinking like a system designer.
