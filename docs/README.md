## ðŸ’¡ Purpose

Here I document:
- How I approached and analyzed problems  
- The reasoning behind design and engineering decisions  
- Lessons learned from challenges and pitfalls  
- Personal methodologies and frameworks distilled from experience  

ðŸ‘‰ In short, this `docs/` folder stores the **meta-knowledge** â€” not just *what I built*, but *how and why I built it*.

## ðŸ”® Future Expansion
- Add more reflections and insights from future projects  
- Include comparisons of successful vs. failed approaches  
- Refine and unify templates for future implementations  
- Continue expanding as my learning journey evolves
